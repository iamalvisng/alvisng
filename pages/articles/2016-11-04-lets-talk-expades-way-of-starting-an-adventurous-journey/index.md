## Because that‚Äôs part of the excitement‚Ä¶

*‚ÄúAdventure are not to be planned.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù. Out of curiosity, we asked.*

*‚ÄúIt depends on what level of planning, I‚Äôm a type of person who‚Äôs fine sleeping on the floor, and I‚Äôm prepared for uncertainties.‚Äù*

Priceless feedback from one of our subscribers, a couple of hours after we introduced [expade.com](https://expade.com). The response amazed us. This exactly was one of the very interesting pointers that puzzled us back in the ideation stage. How detailed should we go on helping our users to plan their adventure? Or should even do it?

An adventure, be it trekking, lakeside camping, or backpacking. It is expected to bring us unique, exciting, and fulfilling experience. The adventure mode has turned on, the pistons are racing, the adrenaline is rushing. The all out moment. The last thing we want to see is an itinerary, a pre-populated ‚Äúplan‚Äù comes with an unordered list as such:

>08:00 p.m. Group briefing

>10:00 p.m. bla‚Ä¶bla‚Ä¶bla

> 12:30 p.m. Lunch

> 01:30 p.m. Group briefing again

> 01:50 p.m. bla‚Ä¶bla..bla..

> 03:30 p.m. The bus is here, go home.

*‚ÄúUgh.‚Äù*

The above scenario, that‚Äôs never our intention.

### Freedom to steer
Instead of hammering on the words planning, we thought of a way. By keeping things simple while maintaining the momentum, Expade being the medium to help to kickstart a journey, make it visible to the world so whoever interested are welcome to join. The members are then given the power and freedom to discuss every detail of the adventure. From transportation to the tent color, all can be discussed and decided within the module. Once everything is in place, game on. It is never our intention to create an ‚Äúadventure planning system‚Äù, we wanted to help adventurers to kickstart an adventure while maintaining the spirit of exploration, which is definitely full of uncertainties, there will never be an adventure if everything is certain and known, is there?

As we‚Äôve proudly [announced](http://bit.ly/2e9EOpH), Expade is a community-powered adventure travel platform. Community being the keyword here. What this means is every adventure are made up by a group of people who would like to partake in an adventurous journey together. While people, freedom, and the adventure experience are on top of the list, we want to keep our interference to the minimum for now. Keeping our ears open for feedback and improve accordingly to best serve our fellow adventurers.

Our core is to take away the bad part while maintaining the good parts (unusual and exciting experience). Altogether, we want to build an adventure travel platform that is ***super simple***, ***super affordable***, and ***super approachable***.
